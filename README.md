## Configuration

Configuration can be performed by creating an `application.conf` file in your classpath.
The [`reference.conf`](src/main/resources/reference.conf) contains all possible configuration parameters with their defaults.
Please also note the [HOCON](https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md) documentation.
